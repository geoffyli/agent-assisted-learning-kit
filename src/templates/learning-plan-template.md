## Learning Overview

### Learning Sequence Summary
<!-- 
DESCRIPTION: Provide a high-level overview of the learning journey, showing how phases connect and build upon each other.

CONTENT TO INCLUDE:
- Brief description of each learning phase and its purpose
- How phases build upon previous knowledge
- Overall learning progression logic
- Key dependencies between phases

FORMAT: Use bullet points with phase names and brief descriptions

EXAMPLE:
- **Phase 1 - React Foundation**: Establish core concepts and vocabulary for React development
- **Phase 2 - React Component Building**: Learn to create and structure React components, building on foundation concepts
- **Phase 3 - React State Management**: Implement complex state handling, requiring solid component knowledge from Phase 2
- ...
-->

### Knowledge Vault Integration Strategy
<!--
DESCRIPTION: Document the plan for organizing learning content within the knowledge vault using Maps of Content (MOC).

CONTENT TO INCLUDE:
- MOC note for this learning, and type (existing or newly created)
- MOC structure and organization approach
- Related Notes in vault that coult have connections with this learning topic.  

FORMAT: Use bullet points paragraphs with specific details

EXAMPLE:
- MOC: React.md (newly created)
- MOC Architecture
    - React.md
        - React Componenets.md
        - React State Management.md
        - ...
- Related Contents
    - Frontend Dev.md
    - Vue.md
    - ...
-->

### Overall Learning Progress Tracking
<!--
DESCRIPTION: Track completion status of each learning phase with simple progress indicators.

CONTENT TO INCLUDE:
- List of all learning phases with completion status
- Current phase being worked on

FORMAT: Use bullet list with phase names and status indicators

STATUS INDICATORS:
- Complete
- In Progress  
- Pending
- Paused

EXAMPLE:
- **Phase 1 - React Foundation**: Complete
- **Phase 2 - React Component Building**: In Progress  
- **Phase 3 - React State Management**: Pending
- ...

## Learning Plan
<!-- Individual learning phases will be generated dynamically by plan command -->
<!-- Each phase follows this standardized format: -->

<!-- 
COMPLETE PHASE EXAMPLES:

### Learning Phase 1: React Foundation

#### Contents
- Understand what React is and its core philosophy
- Learn JSX syntax and how it differs from HTML
- Set up React development environment
- Create your first React application
- Understand the virtual DOM concept

#### Checkpoints
- [ ] Can explain what React is and why it's useful
- [ ] Successfully set up local React development environment
- [ ] Created and rendered your first React component
- [ ] Can write basic JSX syntax without errors
- [ ] Understand the difference between JSX and HTML

#### Knowledge Vault Integration
Create "React Fundamentals.md" note in docs/Knowledge/Tech/ with parent set to MOC React.md. Include subsections for React philosophy, JSX syntax, virtual DOM, and development setup. Link to existing JavaScript notes using wikilinks [[JavaScript ES6]] and [[Web Development]].

#### Resources
- [React Getting Started guide](https://react.dev/learn)
- [**Video Course**: "React Fundamentals" sections 1-2 (Udemy)](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)
- [**Book**: "Learning React" chapters 1-3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk)
- ...

### Learning Phase 2: React Components

#### Contents
- Learn difference between functional and class components
- Understand props and how to pass data between components
- Practice creating reusable components
- Master component composition patterns
- Implement conditional rendering in components

#### Checkpoints
- [ ] Can create both functional and class components
- [ ] Successfully implemented prop passing between parent and child components
- [ ] Built 3 reusable components from scratch
- [ ] Implemented conditional rendering in multiple scenarios
- [ ] Understand component composition best practices

#### Knowledge Vault Integration
Create "React Components.md" note in docs/Knowledge/Tech/ with parent set to MOC React.md. Include subsections for functional vs class components, props, composition patterns, and conditional rendering. Connect to "React Fundamentals.md" using wikilinks and reference [[JavaScript Functions]].
