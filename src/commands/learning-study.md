# Learning Session Study Command

## Purpose
Transform completed learning plan into interactive, guided learning experience with AI-assisted teaching, resource integration, and immediate knowledge vault organization after each phase.

## Command Description
This command takes a completed PLAN phase session and creates an interactive learning experience. It systematically guides users through each learning phase, teaches content, answers questions, validates understanding, and immediately creates organized notes in the knowledge vault after each phase completion. The AI acts as a personalized tutor following the user's custom learning plan with natural Learn → Master → Organize → Advance cycles.

## Command Usage
```
learning-study [SESSION_IDENTIFIER]
```

**SESSION_IDENTIFIER** can be:
- Full session path: `/vault/learn/2024-09-21 React Development`
- Session name: `"2024-09-21 React Development"`
- Topic name: `"React Development"` (finds session by topic)
- Partial match: `"React"` (with disambiguation if multiple matches)

**Examples:**
```
learning-study "React Development"
learning-study "2024-09-21 React Development"  
learning-study "Python"
```

## INPUT PARAMETER PROCESSING

**Parameter Handling:**
- Accept SESSION_IDENTIFIER as command parameter
- SESSION_IDENTIFIER can be: full path, session name, topic name, or partial match
- If no parameter provided, list available learning sessions and ask user to select
- Handle disambiguation when multiple sessions match the identifier

**Session Discovery Process:**
1. Execute: `ls "$VAULT_ROOT/learn/"` to list all available learning sessions
2. Analyze the directory listing and match against user-provided SESSION_IDENTIFIER
3. STOP and report to user: "I found learning session: [SESSION_NAME]"
4. WAIT for user confirmation before proceeding
5. Verify the confirmed session has completed PLAN phase (has learning-plan.md with populated phases)

**Session Discovery Results:**

**USER CONFIRMATION RECEIVED:**
- Set SESSION_PATH to the returned session_path
- Set SESSION_NAME to the returned session_name  
- Log: "Found learning session: [SESSION_NAME]"
- Proceed to Phase 0

**DISAMBIGUATION NEEDED (disambiguation_needed = true):**
- STOP and present disambiguation menu to user:
  
  ```
  Multiple learning sessions match '[SESSION_IDENTIFIER]':
  
  [For each match in matches object]
  [N]) [Session Name] - Status: [Status]
  
  Which session would you like to study? (Enter number)
  ```
  
- WAIT for user selection
- Re-run session discovery with the selected session name
- Proceed to Phase 0 with confirmed session

**NO SESSIONS FOUND (success = false, no disambiguation_needed):**
- STOP execution and inform user of the error
- Present available sessions from available_sessions object:
  
  ```
  [Error message from script]
  
  Available learning sessions:
  [For each session in available_sessions]
  - [Session Name] - Status: [Status]
  
  Please specify a valid session identifier.
  ```
  
- Do NOT proceed to Phase 0

**NO IDENTIFIER PROVIDED:**
- STOP and present all available sessions:
  
  ```
  Available learning sessions:
  [For each session in available_sessions]
  [N]) [Session Name] - Status: [Status]
  
  Which session would you like to study? (Enter number or session name)
  ```
  
- WAIT for user selection
- Re-run session discovery with the selected identifier
- Proceed to Phase 0 with confirmed session

## PHASE 0: SESSION INITIALIZATION & VALIDATION

**0.1. Read Vault Guidelines**
- Read the `AGENTS.md` file at vault root to understand note creation standards
- **Key areas to understand**: MOC patterns, wikilink standards, folder organization, frontmatter requirements
- Ensure all note creation follows vault conventions

**0.2. Run Prerequisites Validation**
- Execute: `.agent/scripts/validate-study-prerequisites.sh --json "$SESSION_PATH"`
- **Script Purpose**: Validates PLAN phase completion, checks learning-plan.md is fully populated, verifies progress tracking system
- Parse JSON output for: `success`, `errors`, `warnings`, `current_phase`, `progress_state`

**SCRIPT EXECUTION FAILURE ACTIONS** (if script fails to run):
- If script cannot be executed (permissions, not found, execution error):
  - **IMMEDIATELY STOP** and inform user of the specific execution error
  - Ask user: "The validation script failed to execute due to [specific error]. Would you like to proceed with manual confirmation of the prerequisites instead?"
  - If user chooses manual confirmation, verify:
    - `learning-plan.md` exists and contains populated learning phases
    - Learning phases have Contents, Resources, Vault Integration, and Checkpoints sections
    - Progress tracking section exists
  - If manual verification passes, proceed to Phase 1
  - If manual verification fails, provide specific remediation steps

**VALIDATION FAILURE ACTIONS** (if script runs but success = false):
- For each error in the errors array, STOP execution and respond with the exact error message
- Do NOT proceed to Phase 1 under any circumstances
- Provide specific remediation steps: guide user to complete PLAN phase first

**0.3. Session Overview & Progress Assessment**
- Load `learning-plan.md` from SESSION_PATH and parse all learning phases
- Analyze current progress state from checkbox completion
- STOP and present session overview to user:

  ```
  Learning Session: [SESSION_NAME]
  Session Path: [SESSION_PATH]
  
  Progress Overview:
  - **Phase 1 - [Name]**: [Complete/In Progress/Pending] ([X/Y] checkpoints completed)
  - **Phase 2 - [Name]**: [Complete/In Progress/Pending] ([X/Y] checkpoints completed)
  - **Phase N - [Name]**: [Complete/In Progress/Pending] ([X/Y] checkpoints completed)
  
  Options:
  A) Continue from where you left off ([Current Phase])
  B) Start from a specific phase (which phase?)
  C) Review completed phases
  D) Start from the beginning
  
  How would you like to proceed?
  ```

- WAIT for user selection and proceed to chosen phase

## PHASE 1: COMPLETE LEARNING PHASE CYCLE

**For each learning phase, follow this complete cycle: Learn → Master → Organize → Advance**

### **1.1. Phase Introduction & Setup**
- Load selected learning phase from learning-plan.md
- Present phase overview to user:

  ```
  Starting: [Phase N: Phase Name]
  
  Learning Objectives:
  [List all Contents items from the phase]

  Success Criteria:
  [List all Checkpoints from the phase]
  
  Ready to begin this phase? (Type 'yes' to start learning)
  ```

- WAIT for user confirmation before beginning content delivery

### **1.2. Interactive Learning & Teaching**

- Access relevant resource files from the `Resources/` folder based on the phase's resource references
- Read the specific resource files referenced in the current phase (e.g., `Resources/filename.md`)
- Use the resource content to inform and enhance your teaching
- Provide comprehensive explanation of the content item
- Use multiple teaching approaches:
  - **Conceptual Explanation**: Clear, structured breakdown
  - **Practical Examples**: Real-world demonstrations
  - **Step-by-step Guidance**: For procedural content
- Make content engaging and appropriately paced
- Connect to user's background knowledge from learning-spec.md
- After teaching each content item, offer Q&A opportunity:  
  ```
  Do you have any questions about [content item]? 
  Ask me anything, or type 'continue' to move forward.
  ```

  - WAIT for questions and provide comprehensive answers
  - Stay within the scope of the current topic and user's learning plan
  - Reference appropriate resources when answering questions
  - If the user asks several follow-up questions, proactively offer to mark the topic for review:
  ```
  It seems like you have a lot of questions about this topic. Would you like to mark it for later review?
  ```


### **1.3. Understanding Validation**

After covering all content items in the phase, validate user understanding through structured checkpoint assessments.

**1.3.1. Checkpoint Assessment Planning**
- Review each checkpoint requirement from the learning plan
- Determine appropriate validation approach for each checkpoint:
  - **Prefer coding challenges** when the topic involves technical implementation
  - **Use conceptual Q&A** for simpler concepts or pure theory
  - Consider the complexity and hands-on nature of the checkpoint

**1.3.2. Practice-Based Validation (Preferred for Technical Topics)**

For checkpoints involving technical skills, implementation, or hands-on practice:

- STOP and present practice challenge in this format:

  ```
  Checkpoint Validation: [Checkpoint description]

  PRACTICE CHALLENGE:

  Scenario: [Real-world context or problem description that requires this skill]

  Task: [Specific objective to accomplish]

  Requirements:
  - [Specific requirement 1]
  - [Specific requirement 2]
  - [Additional requirements as needed]

  [FOR COMPLEX CHALLENGES ONLY] Starter Code Template:
  ```[language]
  // Initial code structure provided here
  // Key sections marked with TODO or comments
  ```

  Please write your solution and share it when ready. I'll review and provide feedback.
  Type 'submit' when you want me to evaluate your code, or 'hint' if you need guidance.
  ```

- WAIT for user to work on the challenge and submit their solution
- When user submits code, evaluate against:
  - **Correctness**: Does the solution solve the problem as specified?
  - **Understanding**: Does the implementation demonstrate mastery of the checkpoint concept?
  - **Code Quality**: Does it follow good practices and patterns appropriate to learning level?
  - **Completeness**: Are all requirements addressed?

- Provide detailed feedback:
  - Highlight what works well and demonstrates understanding
  - Explain any issues or misconceptions clearly
  - Connect feedback to the learning objectives
  - Suggest improvements when relevant

- Based on evaluation:
  - **Mark complete**: If solution demonstrates checkpoint mastery
  - **Offer retry with hints**: If solution shows partial understanding (let user decide whether to retry or mark for review)
  - **Provide teaching**: If fundamental concepts need reinforcement
  - **Offer mark for review**: If user wants to revisit this later

**Challenge Design Guidelines:**
- Make challenges **interview-style** - realistic scenarios that test practical application
- Scope challenges appropriately for single checkpoint (not too broad)
- Provide starter code templates **only for complex challenges** where structure helps focus on key concepts
- For system design/architecture topics, use code-based questions when possible (e.g., "implement this design pattern", "write code demonstrating this architecture")
- Challenge difficulty should match the learning depth specified in learning-spec.md

**1.3.3. Conceptual Validation (For Simpler Concepts or Theory)**

For checkpoints that are purely conceptual or when practice challenges aren't suitable:

- STOP and ask targeted questions:

  ```
  Checkpoint Validation: [Checkpoint description]

  Can you demonstrate or explain this? Please share:
  - Your understanding of the concept
  - An example or practical demonstration
  - How you would apply this knowledge

  (I'll mark this checkpoint as complete once you've demonstrated understanding)
  ```

- WAIT for user response
- Evaluate understanding depth and accuracy
- Provide feedback and clarification as needed
- Apply same completion criteria as practice-based validation

**1.3.4. Retry and Review Policy**

If user's submission doesn't demonstrate mastery:
- Explain what needs improvement with specific, constructive feedback
- ASK USER: "Would you like to:
  - A) Retry with hints and guidance
  - B) Mark this topic for later review and move forward
  - C) Get additional teaching on specific aspects"
- WAIT for user decision and proceed accordingly
- If user chooses retry, provide targeted hints without giving away the complete solution
- Support multiple retry attempts - user controls when to move on

**1.3.5. Checkpoint Completion Criteria**

- **ONLY mark checkpoint complete** when user has demonstrated mastery through:
  - Successful code solution that meets requirements, OR
  - Clear conceptual explanation showing deep understanding
- If user struggles significantly, proactively offer to mark for review:

  ```
  It seems like you're having difficulty with this checkpoint. This is completely normal -
  some concepts take more time to internalize. Would you like to mark this topic for
  later review and move on for now? We'll revisit it after completing this phase.
  ```

- **Track all "marked for review" items** - they will be revisited at phase completion (see section 1.6)
- **ONLY PROCEED to next phase** when ALL checkpoints are either completed or explicitly marked for review by user choice

### **1.4. Immediate Knowledge Organization**
**This happens immediately after mastering the phase, while knowledge is fresh:**

- Present phase completion and organization opportunity:
  
  ```
  Excellent! You've mastered Phase [N]: [Phase Name]
  
  Key concepts you've learned in this session:
  [Summarize specific learnings from this phase]
  
  Now let's organize this knowledge in your vault while it's fresh.
  
  I'll create/update notes following your integration plan:
  [Show vault integration plan from this phase's "Knowledge Vault Integration" section]
  
  Ready to organize these learnings? (Type 'yes' to create notes now)
  ```

- WAIT for user approval before creating notes

### **1.5. Vault Note Creation & Integration**
**Create notes immediately for THIS phase only:**

- Load the phase's "Knowledge Vault Integration" section
- Follow the specific note creation instructions provided
- Create notes according to AGENTS.md standards:
  - Proper frontmatter with parent field
  - Correct file naming conventions: Follow the naming conventions from the learning plan, ensuring not to include "MOC" in filenames.
  - Appropriate folder placement
  - Wikilink integration

- Generate comprehensive note content including:
  - **Core Concepts**: Key learnings from THIS phase
  - **Practical Examples**: User-specific examples discussed in THIS session
  - **Personal Insights**: User's discoveries from THIS phase
  - **Connections**: Links to related vault content
- If a topic is marked for review, add an entry to the "For Review" section in `learning-plan.md`, including the phase number, the topic name, a link to the note (if it exists), and a brief note.
- **Do not** include any "mark for review" information in the vault note itself. The note should only contain the learned content.

- Update relevant MOC according to the overall MOC strategy
- Create bidirectional wikilinks
- Maintain vault organization standards

### **1.6. Phase Completion & Progress Update**
- Update learning-plan.md to mark THIS phase's checkpoints as complete
- **Review Topics Re-validation**:
  - After the phase is complete, check the "For Review" section for topics from this phase
  - For each marked topic:
    - ASK USER: "Would you like to re-attempt [topic name] now that you've completed the full phase?"
    - If yes, present the same practice challenge or conceptual question again
    - Evaluate using the same criteria from section 1.3
    - If user demonstrates mastery, remove from "For Review" section and mark checkpoint complete
    - If still struggling, keep in "For Review" with note to revisit in future sessions
    - If user declines re-attempt, keep in "For Review" for future reference
- Update overall progress tracking section for THIS phase only
- Present completion confirmation and present user with next steps

  ```
  Phase [N]: [Phase Name] - COMPLETE!
  
  Created vault notes:
  - [List created notes with locations]
  
  Updated progress:
  - This phase: All checkpoints completed
  - Overall completion: [X/Y phases complete]
  - Next phase: [Next phase name or "All phases complete!"]
  
  Your knowledge from this phase is now organized in your vault.

  What would you like to do next?
  
  A) Continue to next phase: [Next Phase Name]
  B) Jump to a specific phase
  C) Take a break (save progress and exit)
  
  How would you like to proceed?

  ```

- For **Continue**: Return to 1.1 with next learning phase
- For **Jump**: Allow phase selection and proceed accordingly
- For **Break**: Provide session summary and exit gracefully
